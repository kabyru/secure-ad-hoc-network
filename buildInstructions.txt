There are a few adjustments that need to be made when building secure-ad-hoc-network in 2020.

DEPENDENCIES
openssl
libssl1.0.0-dev

When building and linking, a TYPE DEPENDENCY error occurs for the openssl_cert_add_ext_req function. This has been fixed in this fork.

In the Makefile, the -lssl -pthread flags are required for gcc, as well as a new one: -lcrypto. This was not included in the original release and has been fixed in this fork.
